# Handoff — workwise_web

Read this first in a new chat. Branch: `fix/maps-geocoding-dispatch-and-ai-model`.
Commits so far: `e3040d1`, `77e4434` (run `git log --oneline -5` to confirm).

## Done and committed

- **Root cause of "AI does nothing"**: `lib/services/ai-logger.ts` had a retired
  model (`claude-sonnet-4-20250514`, 404s) hardcoded as default. Fixed — now
  defaults to `claude-haiku-4-5` (tested equal accuracy to Opus on this
  classification task, far cheaper), overridable via `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` env var.
- **Geocoding**: was silently failing (Google billing/API issues swallowed,
  jobs stored with null lat/lng). Now tries free postcodes.io first, Google
  as fallback only. `lib/utils/geocoding.ts`, `lib/utils/places.ts`.
- **Perf**: killed a 500-row fetch used only for `.length`, made `xlsx`
  dynamic-import (was loading on every jobs-page view), replaced
  framer-motion in the sidebar with CSS (it was only animating width/opacity).
- **Login toast** only fired on the first failed attempt — fixed (nonce in
  action result so `useEffect` re-fires).
- **Dispatch modal** redesigned: grouped by worker, shows address/skills,
  labels sourced from `tenant_skills` (was hardcoded).
- **Job clustering** (new): `lib/jobs/assignment-ranking.ts` +
  `autoAllocateJobGroup` in `lib/actions/jobs.ts`. Jobs imported at the same
  postcode are grouped and assigned to one worker as a unit (5 jobs in one
  building → 1 worker, not 5 separate dispatches). If no worker covers the
  union of the group's required skills, it splits by skill signature and
  retries subsets rather than failing the whole site. Also fixed a dead
  load-balancing tiebreaker (was comparing floats for equality, never fired)
  — replaced with a weighted score (`assignmentScore`), 17/17 unit tests pass.
- **Worker skills cap removed** — `MAX_SKILLS = 10` in `worker-form.tsx` and
  `invite-worker-dialog.tsx` was silently blocking any 11th skill with no
  error shown. This was the actual cause of a failed clustering test (worker
  had "all 10 skills" per the cap, but not the two the job actually needed).

## Verified how (in case it matters)

Real job data was exported from Supabase (`jobs_rows.json`, not in repo) and
used to test geocoding, skill detection, and clustering against actual
addresses/postcodes — not synthetic data. Two test CSVs exist at repo root
(untracked): `test-jobs-clustering.csv` (mixed skills, 2 clusters + 2 solo
jobs) and `test-jobs-clustering-noskill.csv` (isolates clustering from
skill-matching).

## In progress — clustering needs one more test

Only one worker currently has auto-assign enabled + matching skills, so every
test so far trivially sends everything to that one worker — doesn't prove
clustering beats plain per-job ranking (vs. there just being no alternative).

**Next step**: add a second test worker, all skills, postcode `NW2 6JN`
(verified real, ~3.4km from the `NW6 5DG` test cluster — close enough to be a
genuine competing candidate, not a trivial win either way). Re-run
`test-jobs-clustering.csv`. Pass = all jobs at one postcode land on the same
worker (either one, doesn't matter which). Fail = a cluster splits across
both workers.

## Not started yet

- **JWT/session perf (Option A1+A2)** — middleware currently does 2 sequential
  network round-trips per request (`getUser()` + a `users.role` query). Plan:
  bake `role` into the JWT via a Supabase auth hook + switch to local JWT
  verification. User explicitly wants this on Opus given it touches every
  authenticated request — discussed but not built.
- **Export rework** — Stripe-style: scope picker (all/page/custom count) +
  column picker. Designed in conversation, not built.
- **Address autocomplete → full postcode enumeration** — Google Places (New)
  cannot list every address at a postcode (confirmed via live test — it's not
  a UK PAF/Royal Mail data lookup). getAddress.io was ruled out (Oct 2025
  High Court judgment against them for using unlicensed Royal Mail/IDDQD
  data — do not use). Parked; user will explain the "finds the street, not
  every house number" limitation to their client for now.
- **Remove "worker name" from import column-mapping options** — flagged by
  user as nonsensical to have there, not yet investigated/fixed.
- **Backfill** — the ~100 real jobs imported before these fixes still have
  null lat/lng and empty skills; would need a one-off re-run script.

## Known, accepted limitations (not bugs)

- AI skill detection isn't perfectly deterministic — identical job
  descriptions can occasionally get slightly different detected skills
  (LLM sampling variance). The clustering split-by-signature logic already
  handles this gracefully.
- Auto-assign is skill-strict (all-or-nothing) by design, per user decision.
